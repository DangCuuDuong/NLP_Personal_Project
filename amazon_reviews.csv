5,"OK, my opinion, this is a great device. Let me start with the capability of connecting by either blue tooth, OR the internet. Yep, that's right, in case you missed it, this device connects via the internet, which can give you much more roaming freedom in your home. The pairing and net connection set-up was quick and painless.

Item comes in a nice solid, good looking case. I checked temperature variation immediately, by placing this item and two different portable units into a glass of water. All were with 1-2 degrees of each other, with this unit being in the middle, one degree different from the other two. I can live with that!! One thing they do get cheap on, helping you charge the unit. This item takes a type 'C' USB cable, to plug into a USB socket. They give you no wall device, OR a charging cable. From headphones to cellphones, I have plenty of type 'C' cables, so it was no big deal. On charging, another item, the blitzy item description states up to 40 hrs. of usage possible. When you look at the manual, it states that fully charged, it may get up to 15 hr.'s of cooking time. That is a BIG drop down from 40 hr.'s, but is still plenty of cooking time. BTW, when you plug it into charge, a green light will start blinking on the base. You need to charge the unit until the green light turns solid, keeping the tool installed in the base. The manual estimates full charge time at 3 hours. As like with a lot of stuff that has batteries, be aware that you most likely will need to charge the unit if their is a good while between usages, or even if you use it a lot. Batteries always run down, in everything. It is a normal happening.

Overall, I am happy with the item, and yes, I would recommend it at this time, prior to actually cooking with it. If the story changes after my first cooking session, I will update this posting.

UPDATE:
Remembering that I had a 2nd oven, I ordered the three probe set also. Now I have a 1 probe set, and a 3 probe set, so that if I am cooking meat in both ovens, I have temperature control. First thing I did with the 3 probe set was to test their reading capability. As I did with the first probe set that I previously purchased, I put all three probes into a glass of water. Two probes had the same temperature, and 1 probe was a degree lower. That works!

COMMENTARY:
Noticed a few reviews where folks stated that they could not register the probes. As a 'just in case', thought I would mention something. When the unit first arrives, the probes are inside of the case, resting in plastic sheaths. These sheaths prevent the probes from making contact with the metal contact plates in the unit. No contact equals the probes do not charge, and neither can the main unit 'see' them. So when you are charging/registering, made sure you get rid of that plastic sheathing that the probes are resting in. Just pull probes out and remove the loose plastic sheathing.

TESTING:
If you are not going to use for a while, or if you are giving as a gift, later on, test, test, test. There is just one piece of tape that you have to cut to open the box do it. Save yourself some potential grief if you find out the unit is defective, after the return period has expired. Charge the unit fully. This will test if all items are recharging. Put probe(s) into glass of water and let sit for a good while (hours) measuring temperature. You want to see if the probe(s) are registering the temperature over time and that the temperature is being picked up by the app. You could also lay the probe(s) in a pan covered with parchment paper (to keep probe(s) from touching pan), in the oven for a while, to test heat readings.

UPDATE:
It is now April 20 and I have been using the probe since purchase in Jan. Have to tell ya, these probes are a life changer. They have worked flawlessly, allowing my meat to come out absolutely perfect! I can cook multiple type of meat at the same time, with one of my probes stuck into it. You select the type of meat you are cooking and the probe software automatically pulls up the right temperature for the meat to be ready at and alerts you as to when rotation is needed, or the meat is done. FANTASTIC!!

One big thing to keep in mind, not all pieces of meat cook the same way. The size matters, and with the probe, it concentrates on the piece of meat that it is stuck into. If you have a thermometer, have multiple pieces of meat, and just insert the thermometer into one piece, that is just judging that ONE PIECE for temperature. Smaller pieces will cook faster that large, and if you have a mixture of sizes, cooking times will vary, and you need to be on top of that. The probes will automatically do that for you.

The fact that I do not have to deal with WIRES makes this sooo much fun! Any serious cook should have this probe set!! You can be guaranteed to have meat cooked to perfection, all the time!"
5,"Absolutely awesome! I’ve had all sorts of cooking thermometers and this is the best so far! I’ve used it 6 times now over the last 2 weeks and everything turns out perfect. I’ve used it in 4 different cuts of meat and it knows exactly when your meal is done.

Takes out all the guess work from the time you put it on the heat, to flipping at the perfect time, removing it from heat and the perfect rest period. Every piece of meat has come out to the exact temperature requested and have been perfectly juicy and flavorful.

App is easy to use and easy to understand. The WiFi and Bluetooth pair quickly and stay connected well during the cook. Unlike the WiFi probe in one of my smokers, this product runs on your regular home WiFi (smoker has its own network) so you have full use of your device through the entire cook."
5,"I bought the hub + 3 probes, for $159.99, right after Christmas 2023, and it arrived in 24 hours.

===========
Setup: 8

I installed and launched the Chef IQ app, from the Google Play store on my phone (as instructed by the quick-start pamphlet). The app then guided me through the remaining steps.

The first thing it instructed was to double-tap the hub's power button. But it didn't power on. I realized the hub's battery may need to be charged, but it doesn't come with a charger... only a USB-C to USB-A cable. (Most folks likely have spare USB-A wall chargers laying around, but it still would've been nice if it was included.) I found a spare charger, plugged it in, double-tapped the hub's power button, and it powered on.

The app's instructions should be changed to include instructions to plug in the hub first, prior to tapping the power button. (Someone less savvy may assume it's defective and return it.)

Next, the app asked to allow Bluetooth access, then choose my WiFi network and type my WiFi password.

Then it asked me to update the hub's firmware. That took 5-10 minutes to complete. No issues.

Now here's the kicker: it makes you create a Chef IQ account, and *verify* your email address, before proceeding. That should not be required, just for a meat thermometer! Annoyed, I provided a fake name, and used one of my throw-away emails (where I don't care if it receives spam). I received a verification email in my email inbox, clicked the link, and within seconds, the Chef IQ app automatically proceeded to the next step: registering the probes with the hub.

I placed the probes in the hub's probe-charging slots, and it quickly recognized each one, and registered them in seconds.

I left everything plugged in to fully charge. The probes finished in 15 minutes. The hub took 2 hours but communicated just fine with the probes during that time.

===========
Accuracy: 7

To test the accuracy of the probes, I tested them in ice water as well as boiling water.

I submerged the probes in a thermos filled with ice water, and swirled it for 2 minutes. I hoped they'd show 32 or 33 F, but they never went below 34 F. The ice was all the way to the button, and the probes were fully submerged in the water. They should've shown 32 not 34 F.

Next, after acclimating the probes back to room temperature, I submerged them in boiling water. Within 15 seconds, they all showed 212-213 F. Excellent.

Aside from my slight disappointment, it's of no real consequence to me, if they're 2 degrees off at near freezing temps. What's important is that they're accurate at higher temps. In that regard, they do operate within specs, at +- 1 degree F.

Some probes on the market have a higher accuracy (0.5 F), but they also cost much more than these probes. Given their price, I'm happy with their accuracy.

===========
Reliability: 9

I did a 4-hour test, where I moved the hub into another room, 40 feet away from the probes. All 3 probes remained connected to the hub the entire time.

The only time one of the probes lost connection was when I sealed the probes in a metal thermos for 2 minutes (during the ice water test). Probe #1 lost connection, while probes #2 and #3 remained connected. When I removed the probes from the thermos, probe #1 automatically reconnected in seconds.

===========
Features: 9

Chef IQ includes features that other companies either don't have, or charge extra for: 4 sensors per probe, Bluetooth, WiFi, and a built-in speaker.

Currently, the only sensors on the market with more sensors is the Meater 2+ and the Combustion Inc. probe, but they are $120 and $150 respectively. At $50 each, you can't beat the price of the Chef IQ probes.

The 5mm diameter of these probes is also thinner than many other probes on the market.

A couple negatives:
1) The hub doesn't have a built-in screen, This prevents my spouse from using the probes, as they're paired exclusively to my phone. A workaround is pairing them to a dedicated device (like a tablet or old phone), but that's not an ideal solution, as it's one more device that you need to remember to charge.
2) The hub only supports 3 probes. I sometimes smoke 4 briskets, and wish I could add a 4th probe.

===========
App: 9

The app is pretty intuitive, with several tabs, at the bottom of the screen, for ""Home"", ""Cook control"", ""Recipes"" and ""More"" features.

Both the ""Home"" and ""Recipes"" tabs include step-by-step guided recipes, with videos.

Unfortunately, ""Home"" prominently features a ""Just For You"" section, with the first recipe being Chicken Francese, which requires the purchase and pairing of the Chef IQ Smart Cooker appliance with the app. Huh? How is that ""just for me""? Why show me recipes it knows I can't actually make?

Fortunately, the ""Recipes"" tab doesn't have that annoyance, and only shows recipes I can prepare with the probes, with ""Oven"", ""Stovetop"", ""Grill"", ""Smoker"" all clearly indicated in each recipe's tile.

The Chef IQ team has clearly invested a lot of effort in creating these interactive recipes. Kudos for a job well done; it adds a lot to the experience.

In the ""More"" tab, there's a cooking history (where I can view all my past cooks), change the hub speaker volume, custom name the probes, and other app tweaks.

The app isn't overly-complicated which I like. But, one feature I hope they add is a way to export the cooking history (e.g., into CSV, XML, JSON, or similar format).

For advanced users like me, providing a public API would be a neat feature, and I hope they consider adding it.

The app and hub don't require WiFi (beyond the initial registration and firmware updates). This is important to me, because if the Chef IQ cloud site goes offline (or my WiFi or internet goes down), I can still set up and monitor my cooks via Bluetooth.

===========
Ease of Use: 8

I think the hub's built-in speaker is a great feature, as it calls out what to do next. E.g., when it's time to flip the steaks, or when it's time to take them off the heat, it gives me a verbal message. That's really neat, as there's been times I've missed the notifications on my phone, in other companies' apps.

But, as mentioned earlier: my spouse can't use the probes, since they're paired only to my phone. I really wish the hub had a basic digital display that showed all the probe temps.

===========
Web site: 3

Their web site is mostly useless. You can't use it to view your cook history, or even to see your probes. At the time of this review, the web site doesn't even recognize your app's login credentials. I.e., if you register your email/password in the app, then try to log in to the web site, it won't recognize your email and you'll need to register again. Why does Chef IQ maintain separate login databases, between their web site and their app? Makes no sense.

===========
Final score: 9

The probes are reasonably accurate, reliable, with decent battery life. If I run into any issues, I'll update this review.

The hub includes great features, like Bluetooth and WiFi, and dunks on its competitors with a surprisingly helpful built-in speaker. But I do hope they consider adding a screen to monitor cooks without relying solely on the app.

The app is intuitive, with a nice balance of usability vs configurability that should appeal to many people. I appreciate the app's guided recipes, and hope they start allowing the community to contribute their own guided recipes. I also like its seamless integration with the hub's speaker.

I hope the Chef IQ team takes a page from Combustion Inc. and removes the annoying login/email requirements. Email verification is pointless! It's not like it's even linked to the (also pointless) web site anyway. Get rid of the needless login/email verification, or at least make it optional.

Despite some annoyances, given the specs and features included at this price, it's the best value on the wireless probe market, and an easy recommendation.

===========

***6-MONTH UPDATE***

POSITIVES:
I smoked two 15-lb briskets, in my Weber Smokey Mountain, and the probes' batteries lasted the entire 11-hour cook. Very pleased.

NEUTRAL:
In the aforementioned 11-hour brisket cook, the hub had to be plugged in, after a few hours.
That's understandable, as it consumes more power, since it has to remain connected to the probes, and broadcast their data to the cloud.

NEGATIVES:
The app automatically purges your cooking history after 6 months, with no way to export that data.

This is a very bad decision by Chef IQ and an unforced error. Why must these logs be purged? They're just tiny files that hardly take up any space; why not allow them to live on my device in perpetuity? Extremely annoying. If maintaining historical cook data is critical for you, you should buy a different brand.

The ambient temperature sensor is often not accurate. As a result, the algorithm that estimates cooking times is often wrong and can't be trusted to plan meal times. Instead, I've been eyeballing the graphs and making common-sense guesstimates.

CONCLUSION:

Overall, I'm still pleased with these probes, and recommend them.

But, the cook time calculations simply can't be trusted. And, the auto-purging of cook history is annoying.

Let's see if Chef IQ fixes these 2 issues in future software updates; I'll update this review, if they do.

Final score (updated): 8.5

===========

***12-MONTH UPDATE***

NEGATIVES:
Probe #1 broke on Dec 25, 2024, during Xmas dinner (within the 1-year warranty).

After a half dozen emails, a phone call, and one month later, Chef IQ shipped out a replacement probe. Probe #1 was back-ordered, so I agreed instead to have them ship me a Probe #3 instead. They assured me that having two No. 3 probes will work fine, and that I can just rename one of them in the app. I'll just have to keep a mental note of which physical #3 probe is which when in the oven.

Final score (updated again): 7.5"
5,Love this thermometer! Works great. Easy to use. It is amazingly accurate and the design is good. I recommend this item.
5,"Por error, primero compre este termómetro y no me percaté qué necesitaba la base, pedí la base con otro termómetro qué tiene como identificación 1 y este que había pedido, tiene como identificación 2, pues lo único que hice, fue sincronizar los dos termómetros con la misma base y me funcionaron muy bien, los super recomiendo, ya que utilice los dos, en diferentes tipos de corte a termino medio y salieron perfectos, solo hay que seguir las instrucciones que va indicando la base / app."
1,"bought this after i had meater for a year, comes with all the bells and whisltes, promising to be a good product, i set it up based on the instructions and couldnt even pass one smoking session in my smoker without it disconnecting every few min, telling me to put the hub close to the probe even though it was less than 40CM away on the smokers shelf, sometimes the bluetooth DC and sometimes the wifi DC but all and all crappy product, dont be lured by the tech of it."
1,"ChefIQ feel Aus is not their market so their app isn’t available in the local store. You need to jump through hoops and change the store on your device to install. This triggers cancellation of local subscriptions in the store.

Stick to other brands."
5,My husband just loves this - uses it on the bbq and says it's the best way to cook his steaks! Comes out perfect every time! Easy to clean too. The speaker is load and clear so you can follow it's instructions very well. Highly recommend!
